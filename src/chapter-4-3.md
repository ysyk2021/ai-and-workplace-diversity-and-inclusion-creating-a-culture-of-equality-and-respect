Hiring and promotion are critical HR processes that can significantly impact diversity and inclusion outcomes. Collecting and analyzing data related to these processes allows organizations to identify potential biases and make informed decisions about how to improve diversity and inclusion outcomes.

* Number of hires made broken down by demographic group
* Time-to-hire broken down by demographic group
* Applicants' demographic information (gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and disability status).

What Promotion Data Should Be Collected?

Once hiring and promotion data has been collected, it should be analyzed to identify patterns and trends.
